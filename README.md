The Garden Project

We created an abstracted model of plants growing within a garden. Each plant has it's own growth life (how long it takes to grow) and particular nutrient/sunlight/water daily needs. The model runs through a number of days (a growing season), and compares the plant's daily needs with the actual values of that day. If the plant's growing conditions are satisfied for that day, we increment it's 'Growing Days' by one, until it reaches it's required number of days to become ripe. 

If, however, the plant does not meet the growing conditions for 3 consecutive days, the plant dies.
